# Hi, I'm ScienceMau 👋
My name is Mauricio Ap. Ribeiro, i'm from 🇧🇷 , my training is focused on exact areas 🖥️. I use programming to perform numerical analysis. However, I am a programming enthusiast and constantly learning. In this repository I will cover scripts to analyze the non-linear dynamic behavior of systems applied in engineering, physics, mathematics, chemistry and biology.

We are under construction. However, this GIT HUB will be for scripts for
The scripts generated here are written in julia, python and matlab.
