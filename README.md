My name is Mauricio Ap. Ribeiro, i'm from üáßüá∑ , my training is focused on exact areas üñ•Ô∏è. I use programming to perform numerical analysis. However, I am a programming enthusiast and constantly learning. In this repository I will cover scripts to analyze the non-linear dynamic behavior of systems applied in engineering, physics, mathematics, chemistry and biology.
